# run_analysis.R

##Summary

The run_analysis.R script ingests two different datasets, each consisting of
three different files, and binds them together into a single dataset. 

The datasets are taken from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
Dataset Version 1.0" experiment. The data consists of accelerometers and gyroscopic measurements
along three axes along with some derived quantities 


##Data format and description
The run_analysis.R script loads different files in order to build a tidy
dataset. The files are the following, where "*" stands for either the "test" or "train" datasets:

* activity_labels.txt:

* features.txt: 

* subject_*.txt:

* y_*.txt

* X_*.txt:



##Data Analysis
The analysis performed by the run_analysis.R script is straightforward. First,
the necessary files are loaded
